# Cervical_Cancer_Prediction
# Introduction
Cervical cancer is a significant health concern globally, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where regular screening and early detection are less accessible. The disease is primarily caused by persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types, making it a preventable and treatable condition if detected early. However, many women still face the risk of late-stage diagnosis, leading to higher mortality rates. The integration of machine learning models in the prediction and early diagnosis of cervical cancer can potentially reduce these risks by identifying high-risk individuals based on various factors and enabling timely intervention.

## Aim and Objectives

The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately assess the risk of cervical cancer in individuals..The use of machine learning algorithms, the project seeks to improve the early detection of cervical cancer, thereby aiding in the prevention and management of this disease.

Objectives
    Data Understanding: I explored and understood the key variables
    Data Preprocessing: I cleaned the dataset and handled missing values,Converted specified columns to binary values..
    Exploratory Data Analysis: I analyzed the data to identify patterns and relationships.
    Feature Engineering: I selected the important features for prediction Model Development: I built machine learning models to predict cervical cancer risk.
    Model Evaluation:I evaluated the model performance using accuracy and other metrics.
    Google Colab Implementation: I implemented the entire process in Google Colab.

# Dataset
This cervical cancer dataset contains medical and demographic information about individuals, focusing on risk factors associated with cervical cancer. It includes features such as age, number of sexual partners, age at first sexual intercourse, pregnancy history, smoking habits, use of hormonal contraceptives and intrauterine devices (IUDs), and history of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The dataset includes results from cervical cancer detection tests like Hinselmann, Schiller, cytology, and biopsy. The data was used to build machine learning models aimed at predicting cervical cancer diagnoses, helping in early detection and improving patient outcomes.

# Data Preprocessing


# Exporatory Data Analysis


# Modelling
1. Random Forest (RF): 99.40%
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM): 98.80%
3. Logistic Regression (LR): Mean Squared Error: 0.0065
4. AdaBoost: 98.80%
5. CatBoost: 99.40%

Among these models, Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy, making it the most effective for predicting cervical cancer risk in this case.
